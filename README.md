## jQuery Practice Project

Write the code to make clicking on the 'change-highlight' button give a box on the DOM the 'highlight' class to turn the box red.
Each time the 'change-highlight' button is clicked, it should give the next square
the 'highlight' class.
Only 1 box should be highlighted at a time.
You will need to add to the highlightASquare function, you are also welcome to write more than the given functions.

VERY USEFUL HINT: [jQuery has good methods for finding and for changing an element's class](https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/class-attribute/)

ANOTHER HINT: There is an array in the highlightASquare function. You will need to find a way to keep track of an index of that array.

## jQuery Pro Practice Project (optional)

Write code to make the number on the DOM countdown each second. Only one number should be displayed on the DOM at a time.

HINT: look into javascript's setInterval() function.

BONUS 1: Add a button for the user to reset the timer.
BONUS 2: Make something cool happen using a jQuery animation when the timer gets to zero.

**ToDo**
[ ] - write code to decrement text every second
[ ] - add button to reset timer
[ ] - use jquery animation when timers gets to zero
